# TwitterAPIGui
Just a fun little GUI to interact with sections of the twitter API.

You need to install Tweepy with pip install:
 - Tweepy (Pip install tweepy)
 - Pyfiglet (Pip install pyfiglet)
 
You also will need a Developer Account for Twitter. They're free, just they take time to get approved. 
Head over to Developer.twitter.com to create a free account.
