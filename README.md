Just a fun little tool to interact with sections of the twitter API.

You need to install Tweepy with pip install:
 - Tweepy (Pip install tweepy)
 - Pyfiglet (Pip install pyfiglet)
 
You also will need a Developer Account for Twitter. They're free, just they take time to get approved. 
Head over to Developer.twitter.com to create a free account.

*IMPORTANT* **Make sure your app has Read, Write, and Direct Message enabled**

(Also, I'm aware there's some options that add, but there's no option to remove. Like how it can DM someone, but cannot delete that DM, or read the DM's. I will add those at a later date, just not now.)
