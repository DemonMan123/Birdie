# Twitter-API-UI
Just a fun little GUI to interact with sections of the twitter API.

You need to install Tweepy with pip install:
 - Tweepy (Pip install tweepy)
 - Pyfiglet (Pip install pyfiglet)
 
You also will need a Developer Account for Twitter. They're free, just they take time to get approved. 
Head over to Developer.twitter.com to create a free account.

(Also, I'm aware there's some options that add, but there's no option to remove. Like how it can DM someone, but cannot delete that DM, or read the DM's. I will add those at a later date, just not now.)
